# Telecom_churn-data-analyst

Overview
Welcome to my repository where I explore telecom churn data sourced from Kaggle. Churn analysis is crucial for telecom companies aiming to understand customer behavior and reduce customer attrition. Through this project, I dive into various aspects of the dataset to uncover insights that inform strategic decisions.

Key Highlights
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, I conduct comprehensive EDA to uncover patterns and correlations within the data. Visualizations are employed to gain insights into factors influencing churn rates.

Feature Engineering: I explore feature engineering techniques to enhance predictive modeling accuracy and explore different strategies to improve model performance.

Predictive Modeling: Leveraging machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, I build predictive models to forecast customer churn. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess model effectiveness.

Repository Structure
Data: Contains the raw dataset.

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step EDA and predictive modeling process.

Future Projects
In future iterations, I plan to:

Data Cleaning: Find and clean additional data to enhance the accuracy and completeness of the analysis.
Power BI Integration: Explore integrating Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and reports from the analyzed data.
Insights and Applications
By analyzing telecom churn data, I aim to uncover actionable insights that help telecom companies in customer retention strategies and business decision-making. This repository serves as a learning resource for data analysts and data scientists interested in churn analysis and predictive modeling.
